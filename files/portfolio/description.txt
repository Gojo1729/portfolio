A little description on the attached videos. These are the result of the features I had built in the previous company. All are from the Android app 
called "Rizzle" (my previous company).

1. MT1.mp4 - This the video output of a feature called "Motion Tracking". You can see that the video frames are moving
according to the person's face movement. This feature enables users to create videos which are more dynamic and fun.

2. GD.mp4 - Using pointing gesture to select options displayed on the screen.

3. FT.mp4 - This the video output of a feature called "Face transformation", this creates a video where it fuses the two faces together in a pretty
dramatic and smooth manner.
