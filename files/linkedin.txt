1) Designed and implemented backend architecture using WebSockets, NodeJS, Redis, and ExpressJS to 
manage real-time audio streams from Twilio, facilitating conversations with a language model (GPT-
4) with latency under a second.

2) Collaborated in designing MySQL databases and cache system to support the application, ensuring
efficient handling of 1000 inbound and outbound calls daily.

3) Utilized Docker to manage multiple NodeJS, FastAPI, MySQL, Redis, RabbitMQ microservices for
streamlining the deployment to stage and production servers.

4) Engineered a robust queuing system utilizing Celery, RabbitMQ, and Redis to oversee outbound call 
campaigns for 1000 contacts. This system managed Twilio’s rate limit, retried calls in case of failure 
due to the rate limit or unanswered calls, processed large documents, and created indexes in the 
Pinecone vector database for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). It tackled scalability issues, 
maintained smooth API performance across multiple servers, and resolved time zone conflicts for 
meeting scheduling with Cal.com.

5) Developed background tasks for CRM report generation (e.g., Salesforce) by processing audio 
transcriptions from user-bot conversations, enhancing CRM data utility.1)
